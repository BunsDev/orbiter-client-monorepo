### Orbiter Finance’s Bridge Protocol
Roles in Cross-rollup Transaction[](#roles-in-cross-rollup-transaction)

**Sender:** The user who engages with cross-environment interoperability systems to initiate transactions.

**Maker:** The provider responsible for furnishing cross-rollup services, ensuring seamless connectivity between different networks.

**Dealer:** Receives incentives for providing decentralised frontends. (Will be further explained in Chapter ‘Roadmap to Ultimate Trustless’.)

**Submitter:** Responsible for submitting the root of the revenue tree generated by Dealers. (Will be further explained in Chapter ‘Roadmap to Ultimate Trustless’.)


Orbiter Finance's main goal is the creation of a secure and decentralised cross-rollup bridge within the Ethereum ecosystem. It has been developed with the aim of improving the interoperability of mainnet-rollup. To achieve this goal, Orbiter Finance originally designed the cross-rollup transactions based on an optimistic principle, assuming all transactions are valid and configure an Arbitration Mechanism where users can issue an arbitration case and challenge the result of a cross-rollup transaction.

Upon examining the transaction log through a block explorer, a distinct feature can be found: Senders will directly initiate the transaction to a Maker's externally owned address (EOA), rather than a contract address. This distinction sets Orbiter Finance apart from other bridge protocols. Makers have the option to develop and operate a client that automates the service, or they can utilise the open-source client provided by the Orbiter Finance team.

Following the initiation of transaction from Sender to Maker on the source network, Maker assumes the responsibility of transferring the assets to the Sender on the destination network. Maker will confirm the three crucial parameters listed below to complete the transaction.

Token Standards: The protocol accommodates ETH and ERC-20 Tokens. When Makers deposit margin in the MDC (Maker Deposit Contract), it is required to specify the withholding fee (a predetermined fee), the trading fee (a certain percentage of the transaction amount), and the endorsed token. These defined parameters will be retained within the EBC (Event Binding Contract) and consistently synchronised with the Maker Client end. (Note: Owing to the fluctuating nature of gas fees, Orbiter Finance will periodically adapt its fees based on the Gwei rate of the destination network. This is done to maintain Orbiter Finance’s charging fees at a level below the prevailing average. It's important to note that these adjustments will not occur frequently. Senders can refer to the Orbiter website to view the current fee rates. Some maths for you to better understand the charging guideline.

e.g., When you transfer 1ETH from Mainnet to zkSync, the Trading Fee is 0.03% of the transfer amount and the Withholding Fee is 0.0014ETH, the cost of the transfer is: 0.03%*1ETH+0.0014=0.0017ETH e.g., When you transfer 100 USDC from Mainnet to zkSync, the Trading Fee is 0.3% of the transfer amount and the Withholding Fee is 1.5USDC, the cost of the transfer is: 0.3%*100 USDC+1.5USDC=1.8USDC)

Amount Sender Receive: Upon confirming the designated token type that the Sender should receive, Maker will perform the calculation as per the formula in EBC for the precise amount the Sender is entitled to receive. (Contracts functionalities and formulations will be explained later on.)

Destination Network: Orbiter Finance employs an "Identification Code" to distinguish between various Destination Networks. This "Identification Code" is appended to the final four digits of the transfer amount, allowing the Maker to determine the right Destination Network for executing the transaction. Meanwhile, please be noted that any modification made by the Sender to this transaction will result in the transaction failing.

See the sheet below to find the Identification Code for different networks, please be noted that the Code for networks on Mainnet remain TBC if it is only live on testnet.


## Inscriptions Cross-Rollup Protocol

Building upon the existing cross-rollup communication, we've extended functionalities to encompass inscriptions minting and crossing.

The fundamental principle involves users submitting transactions containing basic inscriptions information and the identification code for the target network to the Maker Protocol. These transactions are processed by the Orbiter Bridge Protocol. On the target network, the Maker Protocol utilizes mint and cross functions to send inscriptions to the user's address, completing the entire inscriptions cross-rollup process.

Currently, this protocol early supports networks including Arbitrum One, Optimism, zkSync Era, Base, Linea, Scroll, and Polygon zkEVM. The Orbiter Bridge Protocol collects a certain fee on the source network as the Inscriptions Cross-rollup Protocol fee.


	
### Inscriptions Minting

#### Deploy
##### The inscription contract can be deployed on any network. The `to` address of the recipient of the deployed contract transaction is the owner of the contract. With ownership of the contract, you can help anyone deploy the contract and set the owner to his address.
#### Note: The protocol + tick will form a unique identifier in the entire network. If the contract protocol and tick you are not familiar with already exist, your deployment will be invalid.

```
{"p": "xxx-20", "op": "deploy", "lim": "10000", "max": "xxxxx", "tick": "Name"}
```
|  Field   | Required  | Remark  |
|  ----  | ----  | ---- |
| p  | YES | Ex:xxx-20 Supported Protocol |
| op  | YES | deploy|
| lim  | YES | Maximum casting amount for a single transaction |
| max  | YES | Maximum circulation |
| tick  | YES | EX:xxx-20 Inscriptions' Name |

#### Claim
#### You can choose any network to select the target network, use the inscription contract protocol information to initiate a claim transaction, and cast the inscription contract you want on the target network simply and conveniently. The main method is to send fixed inscription contract through the following inscription protocol JSON data + The handling fee amount + security code are used as transaction data and are executed on the target network. This process does not require you to operate on the target network, and there is no handling fee.
#### Note: When the Claim transaction is initiated, the `to` field of the on-chain transaction receiving address is the owner when the inscription contract is deployed. For the inscription protocol and tick you want to mint, the maximum minting amount for a single transaction must be within the parameters set by the deployment contract, otherwise your creation will not take effect.
- Basic data
```
{"p": "xxx-20", "op": "claim", "amt": "1000", "tick": "Name"}
```
|  Field   | Required  | Remark  |
|  ----  | ----  | ---- |
| p  | YES | Ex:xxx-20 Supported Protocol |
| op  | YES | claim Initiate Cross-Rollup Mint Action |
| tick  | YES | EX:xxx-20 Inscriptions' Name |
| amt  | YES | Ex:1000 Mint Amount |
- Casting fee and Identification Code
  - The casting fee is a fixed value, currently 0.00023ETH (or equivalent amount)
  - The identification code is determined internally by the protocol, and each network has a unique identification code identifier. The identification code identifier is consistent with the Orbiter cross-rollup protocol. For details, see: https://docs.orbiter.finance/orbiterfinancesbridgeprotocol
- Then the casting fee is 0.00023 + the identification code is 9001, then the value amount of the sent transaction should be set to: 0.0002300000000009001. As long as the casting fee is higher than the protocol casting fee and the last 4 digits of the protocol identification code are guaranteed, then the casting will go smoothly at the target network execution.


#### Mint
#### This process does not require user participation. After the source network initiates a claim, the protocol node will automatically execute casting on the target network after the transaction is confirmed.
```
